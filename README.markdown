#g8's project template featuring scala, scalaz and sbt-revolver.

Heavily inspired from:

* [sample-unfiltered](https://github.com/GoBoundless/sample-unfiltered)
* [scala-sbt](https://github.com/typesafehub/scala-sbt.g8)
* My own [scala-sbt-revolver](https://github.com/adinapoli/scala-sbt-revolver.g8)


##Requirements

You need to install [giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8)

##Why Scalaz 7?

Because it will be the new officially supported Scalaz version. It has
been partially rewritten and it's close to the functional style than
version 6.0
